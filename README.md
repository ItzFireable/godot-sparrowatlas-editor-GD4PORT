A plugin made to convert Adobe Flash .xml animations to Godot animation type, 
making easier to handle multiple spritesheets.

## How to use
**Setting up**

Make sure to have a .xml file generated by Adobe flash and it's spritesheet, put their resource path inside, depending of what animation you want to import, 
insert it's name on prefix section correctly.
Also there's a tool that allows you to do a custom offset, some animations might flick when switching from one to other usually, 
so that tool is now your friend to help you ou.

**The prefix can be found inside the .xml file.**

**Exporting the new animation as a file**

After configurating everything you need, hit "Save" and select the directory you want to save it in.

Simple enough, just import as a normal animation in any animationplayer node.
