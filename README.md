The **Friday Night Funkin: Gamemaker Remake** *(FNF: GMS2 Remake)* for short, is a remake of the game titled **Friday Night Funkin** by ninja_muffin99 & friends on itch.io.
If you have not played the original game, *please* play it [here](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin).

This project is a passion project, and **I will not profit** from this remakes creation.

## Download
Here **[here](https://github.com/ImCodist/Friday-Night-Funkin-Gamemaker-Remake/releases/)**

## Motivation
I made this out of *love for the original game* and to *improve* my skill in new areas of Gamemaker Studio.\
As a result I have learned how to work with *higher-res graphics*, and how to make a *ddr style rhythm game*.

## How to use
**Setting up**

Make sure to have a .xml file generated by Adobe flash and it's spritesheet, put their resource path inside, depending of what animation you want to import, 
insert it's name on prefix section correctly.
Also there's a tool that allows you to do a custom offset, some animations might flick when switching from one to other usually, 
so that tool is now your friend to help you ou.

**The prefix can be found inside the .xml file.**

After configurating everything you need, hit "Save" and select the directory you want to save it in.

Simple enough, just import as a normal animation in any animationplayer node.
